# \*\*Spike Plan

==============

**Name:**

Daniel Maddern

## Context

Need to upskill in understanding of how SCORM works, how it can be intergrated into Angular project
and how it can meet the requirements of this project.

**Knowledge Gap:**

-Working with SCORM -Intergration SCORM with Angular -Understanding which functions are required for
an implementation

**Skill Gap:**

-SCORM content packaging -SCORM runtime enviroment -SCORM Content Aggregation Model

**Technology Gap:**

-Understanding the javascript functions and their purposes -Understanding how this intergrates and
ties in with Angular -Understanding how the API can be used to save data from the SCORM player

## Goals/Deliverables

In this spike I will be researching the various elements of SCORM the key outcomes will be:
-understanding what functions we need in a scorm player -understanding how the javascript works
-understanding how this can be embedded in Angular -understanding the various APIs we can use to
work with Numbas via SCORM.

**Planned start date:**

5/4/2023 Term 1 2023

**Deadline:**

12/4/2023 Term 1 2023

## Planning notes

Outline a proposed plan of how this spike can be undertaken.

<https://scorm.com/scorm-explained/technical-scorm/>

-A summary of understanding of how SCORM players work -A summary of how SCORM can be interegrated
into Angular -Review NUMBAS APIs and how we can make use of them for this task.
