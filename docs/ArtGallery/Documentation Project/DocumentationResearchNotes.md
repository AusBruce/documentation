## Documentation/Knowledge Bases: Research

### Preamble

The aim of this research is to better understand how Confluence can be used to produce a knowledge
base that would be most effective for the needs of this project, and to provide any future members
working on this project with direction to helpful and important information.

### Resources

- [The Atlassian Guides:](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/guides/) Useful for getting
  started with confluence and learning the basics. Begin with Part 1: Get started with Confluence to
  go through the guides in order to get more in-depth as you progress.
- [Software Testing Help Beginner’s Guide:](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/atlassian-confluence-tutorial/)
  A good starting point for confluence as it clearly defines key concepts. Makes notes of the
  advantages of working with the software, showing how it is best used. Works through creation on
  the platform, with clear instructions.
- [Confluence Documentation Tutorial 2023:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emn3hoamV-M) Tutorial
  that goes through basic processes on the site, showing how to navigate and contribute to a space.
- [Simon Confluence Tutorial for Beginners:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p3QzaS33GA) Active and
  in-depth introduction to confluence concepts, as well as touring the platform to help with
  navigation.

These guides and resources cover similar content, but do so with different methods that will be more
to the benefit of various learning preferences.

### Consideration

- In the case of purchasing a plan, the choice between cloud, data centre and server hosting.
  - Given that cloud hosting is the simplest with the most details taken care of by the platform
    itself, it seems to be the best solution.
  - While a server would offer more robust admin controls, because the responsibilities and
    authority between delivery leads and project members is fairly even within the project, it
    doesn’t seem necessary to have very many restrictions in place.
- For use of confluence without purchasing a plan: the current free plan only allows for 10 members
  per site.

### Concepts

- Pages are live documents that make up the knowledge base, collaborative pieces that can be used
  for notes, guides or policies.
- Spaces are how pages are organized, with pages of similar content being in the same space.
  Depending on the amount of content you have to organise or how large each page is, you may only
  need a single space with each page acting as the central document for a particular topic or area
  of the project.
- A page tree organizes pages hierarchically under related spaces and other pages to allow for
  simple navigation. These sub-pages are as robust as the parent pages they are nested under and are
  utilized for the sake of order.
- Every space has a space overview, which is essentially the root page of the space which is always
  seen first when entering the space. This is a useful feature to give a brief overview of the
  space, navigation, and the content within.

### Features

- Pages and content within pages can be labelled in order to organise or contextualize a page, such
  as a page being currently worked on being labelled as “In Progress” or certain content being
  labelled as “Disputed” if there are disagreements surrounding it that need to be resolved.
- Content can be restricted (read-only) depending on the space settings, and certain members may
  have different permissions depending on their roles. These global settings can divide between
  contributing members and reading members. Individual pages can have restrictions placed upon them.
- Confluence makes use of a variety of templates for pages, streamlining the process of creating new
  pages for different purposes. Templates can be used as a basis for the project’s own personal
  templates within Confluence.
- In editing pages, changes made are automatically synced and available to other members in editing,
  however the changes are not made publicly available for viewing until the page is “published’, at
  which point the page is changed and the previous version is stored in the version history. Changes
  can be reverted to the last version during editing.
- There is integration for markdown code and MS Teams within Confluence, relevant to this project as
  important markdown snippets from GitHub can be more easily transferred to Confluence if needed,
  and MS Teams integration can allow for less divide between communication and learning channels for
  members of the project, given that Teams is a core communication channel.
